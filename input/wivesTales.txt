First write out a prayer, similar to the one below, 
although modified for the particular position you are 
seeking. Then light a white candle and sincerely pray the 
prayer each morning, starting as soon as you have decided 
that this is where you wish to work. Obviously, you should 
change this prayer to suit the job you wish to obtain, 
mentioning both the position and the office that you wish 
to obtain work in with as much detail as possible. The detail 
of the organization and the information about the position 
you want in that organization are both important. 
Obtain two orange candles. One candle should be 
substantially larger than the other is. You are to set the two 
candles out where you regularly burn candles. The smaller 
candle is placed into a candleholder and prepared for lighting. 
The larger candle is laid down next to the smaller candle. 
Now you make a prayer similar to the following, and then 
light the smaller candle. Be certain that you allow the smaller 
candle to burn completely out.
Take a red candle, a red birthday candle will do fine, 
and light it with a sincere prayer that you find someone 
with whom to have sexual intercourse. Now after the candle 
burns out, or even while it is still burning, you should go 
out and look for the kind of person with whom you want 
to have sexual relations.
Take a half a teaspoon of ground sesame seed, and a 
tablespoon of fresh un-brewed ground coffee. Add a hair or 
other trace from the person whose passions are to be raised, 
even a strand of your own hair if that is what is desired. 
Mix the ingredients together well. Then pray over the 
mixture for the effect desired, and seal it in a closed container, 
like a small cardboard pillbox, or an envelope. 
Take an equal measure of ground Clove, Cinnamon, and 
Cardamom. A tablespoon of each is more than enough. Place 
these in a jar or pan, and pray over them for the return of your 
lost love, calling your lost love by name. Fill the jar or pan with 
rosewater, covering over the spices. Now add a piece of 
parchment or heavy writing paper that has the name of your 
lost love written clearly on it. In the corners of this paper, write 
the names of the four apostles, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and 
John. As you write the names of the apostles, pray to each of 
them to help return your lost love to you. Now place this 
mixture over a slow fire, and bring it to a boil. Allow the mixture 
to boil briefly. A half a minute is quite enough. Then take the 
container off the fire, and allow the mixture to cool to room 
temperature. Place the mixture in a jar, and hide it away. If you 
decide to repeat the spell, you should add the new mixture to 
the old, allowing the mixture to accumulate.

Place the seeds on the paper, direcdy over the crossed names. 
Next, cover the names and the seeds with red powder. (Binney 
and Smith red powdered water paint, ground powdered red 
chalk, or Indian red Kum-kum powder, you have your choice 
of which kind of powder you wish to use, it makes no 
difference.) Roll up the paper, doing your best to keep the 
seeds and the powder inside. You will have to twist the ends of 
the paper to keep everything in place. Finally, tie the paper 
closed around the center, using a piece of iron wire.
